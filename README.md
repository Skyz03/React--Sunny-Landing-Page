## My process

My Brief Working process for this landing page includes:
1. Thinking in React to break Components. 
2. Creating the Components as per the design such as Nav.jsx and others.
3. Adding Animations on scroll in the Home Page to make it Complete.
4. Used React Router to implement diffrent pages such as Coming Soon & Contact Page.
5. Implement Formik for Contact Page.
6. Implement React Loading Library in the App.
7. Implement Theme such as Dark/Light Theme.
8. Deply in Github.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material UI
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Formik
- AOS (Animation on scroll)
- React Load
- Local Storage for Theme.

### What I learned

During this project I learned a lot of React techniques as I implemented the fundamentals what I leanred to create this landing page.

Plus points right now is I implemented diffrent external libraries such as Formik, React Load and many more which are integrated in this application.

### Continued development

A better clean application can be made in future with a much better approach.
